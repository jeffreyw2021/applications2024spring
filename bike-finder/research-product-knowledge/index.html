        <h3>How I picked and used my sources:</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a bike rider myself, so I had the experience of how to pick a bike and what to look for, and that is
            where majority of my knowledge came from. For more professional and technical aspect of information like
            bike wheel size, frame size, etc, I looked up on Wikipedia for specific parameters and numeric data. Then I
            also looked up two sources of articles that are more general and easy to understand for beginners so I can
            take on the perspective of someone who never had the experience of buying a bike before and see what
            information they will be exposed with before they begin their purchase.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>What big questions will a buyer will be faced with?</p>
                <p>
                    Buyers will likely face decisions regarding the type of bike best suited for their activities, the
                    size and
                    fit for comfort and performance, and how much to invest considering quality and price. Brand
                    reputation and what after-sales services are offered are also a key concern especially for new
                    buyers. Additionally, buyers often consider the availability of accessories and the potential for
                    future upgrades.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What priorities might they have?</p>
                <p>
                    Buyers' priorities may include the primary use of the bike (commuting, racing, leisure), comfort and
                    ergonomic fit, durability and maintenance needs, budget constraints, and personal preferences in
                    style or brand. Environmental impact and the desire for eco-friendly transportation options might
                    also be a priority for some buyers, but may be less of a concern for others.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>What did you run into that you didn't understand, and now you do?</p>
                <p>
                    Initially, I was more confused about the technical aspects of bike, such as the
                    frame size, wheel sizes, and frame materials. Through this research, I now have a
                    better understanding of how these factors influence the bike's performance, comfort, and suitability
                    for different types of riding, as well as how they affect the bike's price. Also, it was very
                    helpful for me to gather the technical and numerical data for these kind of information, as they
                    will be very useful when it comes to constructing the information architecture of the website.
