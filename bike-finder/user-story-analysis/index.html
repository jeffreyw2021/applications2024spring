            <strong>Evaluation Algorithm:</strong><br>
            Each user story is evaluated based on three criteria: commonality, achievability, and priority to the
            persona. These are rated on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest). The final score for each user story is
            the average of these three dimensions.
