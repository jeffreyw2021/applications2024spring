            This is the spreadsheet where I filtered through the user stories and picked the ones with the highest
            scores (3), which I'll take into consideration when deciding on UI components and features. For the final
            prototype deliverable, I plan to make 3 pages: a home page, a product detail page, and a shopping cart page,
            and I drafted lists of UI components that I'll include for each page in the spreadsheet, too.
