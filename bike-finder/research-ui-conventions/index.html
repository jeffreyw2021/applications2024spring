        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring
                    the specific product?</p>
                <p>
                    Complete boards are not shown on the homepage as display items, so I went on to the top navigation,
                    and under the expandable 'skateboard' category button there is an option for 'Completes'. I went in
                    to the 'Completes' catalog and tried to use the filter, but the filter is only for 'Brands' and
                    'Avaliability'. So I went down to the pagination control button and found the complete assembled
                    longboards this brand has on the second page of the catalog.
                    <br />
                    Then I picked a board that I like, and went into its detail page. The page has a very classic layout
                    of item images on right and item description on left. Below these two sections there's a section for
                    recommended products.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
                <p>
                    The top navigation bar is quite common in online shopping sites, and the expandable category button
                    is also quite common. The catalog with multiple pages that users can go back and forth with
                    pagination control buttons is also quite conventional and useful when it comes to online stores
                    where they need maximum scalability of their item display UI. The filter, while not used so well in
                    this webpage, is also a very common UI component.
                    <br />
                    In terms of the detail page, the layout of item images on right and item description on left is
                    very conventional in online shopping sites. The recommended products section is also a common
                    practice.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
                <p>
                    I was certain about whay these elements will do before I interacted with them, as they are very
                    conventional components of an online shopping site.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What specific problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
                <p>
                    The main goal of the top navigation bar is to allow users to navigate to different pages, and
                    embeding drop down buttons in it allows users to have a clearer idea of the store's product
                    categories. The catalog page with pagination control buttons is designed to allow users to browse
                    through the store's products in an intuiative way, as well as allowing the store to scale up and
                    down in terms of the number of products they have flexibly.
                    <br />
                    In the detail page, the layout of item images on right and item description on left is designed to
                    allow users to see
                    the item's images and description at the same time, and the recommended products section is designed
                    to allow users to see other products that they might be interested in.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What other UI elements could have been used in this context? Why were they not used?</p>
                <p>
                    In the catalog section, more advanced filtering options (like by price range, board size, or
                    customer ratings) could have been implemented to enhance user experience. They may not have been
                    used to keep the interface simpler or due to technical limitations.
                    <br />
                    For the product detail page, interactive elements like a zoom function on images or a 360-degree
                    view could provide a better understanding of the product. These features might not be present due to
                    resource constraints or the website's design philosophy focusing on simplicity.

                <p>What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and configuring
                    the specific product?</p>
                <p>
                    Since I don't see an option on homepage for monitors' catalog immediately, I went on to the search
                    bar and searched for '32" 4K monitor'. Then the products avaliable are shown in a catalog that can
                    be scrolled vertically and has two pagination controls one on top and another at the bottom. There's
                    also a 'sort by' dropdown menu that allows users to sort the products by closest match, highest
                    rating, most reviewed, highest price, lowest price.
                    <br />
                    Then I picked a monitor that I like with a good star rating on its product card in the catalog, and
                    went into its detail page. The page has a three column layout, with the item images on left, item
                    description in the middle, and pricing & delivery/pick up option on left with the 'add to cart' and
                    'buy now' buttons.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
                <p>
                    The search bar is quite common in online shopping sites, and the catalog with multiple pages that
                    users can go back and forth with pagination control buttons is also quite conventional. The
                    'sort by' dropdown menu is also a very common UI component. The star ratings on the card is not as
                    conventional, but if a store has a customer review system, it is often present.
                    <br />
                    In terms of the detail page, the three column layout is not so commonly seen, as usually the item
                    description and pricing are on the same (usually right) column.When I change the browser width to be
                    smaller, the layout changes to a two column layout with the item images on left and item pricing on
                    right, then the item description moves to below them.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
                <p>
                    I was certain about whay these elements will do before I interacted with them, as they are very
                    conventional components of an online shopping site.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What specific problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
                <p>
                    The search bar facilitates easy access to specific products. The 'sort by' feature organizes
                    products based on user preferences, making decision-making easier. The pagination control manages
                    large inventories effectively. The three-column layout in the product detail page provides
                    comprehensive information (including pricing and delivery options) at a glance.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What other UI elements could have been used in this context? Why were they not used?</p>
                <p>
                    A filter feature for technical specifications (like screen size, resolution, or brand) could have
                    been included for more refined searches. It might not be used to avoid making the interface too
                    complex or cluttered.
                    <br />
                    Interactive elements like comparison tools or customer Q&A sections could provide additional value.
                    These might be absent due to development priorities or to maintain a streamlined user experience.

                <p>
                    After clicking on the the basic water bottle product that I wanted from the homepage, I was taken to
                    a detail page of this bottle. In it, there's a vertically scrollable list of bottle's images on the
                    left, and a collection of customization options in button groups for the bottle on the left of the
                    UI. Below these two components, there's a section of detailed description and advertisement of the
                    bottle, and further down below there's a user's review section that shows a score and comments from
                    the users.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
                <p>
                    The customization options in button groups seems to be quite a standard element for products that
                    allow a certain degree of customization, and sometimes even switching between two products that are
                    not vastly different from each other. In this case, we can select to have a bottle that is insulated
                    or non-insulated, its color, and its size.
                    The large description and the user review sections below are also quite commonly seen in online
                    shopping sites like Amazon, Walmart, etc.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
                <p>
                    I'm quite sure about what the customzation options will do when I interact with them as they are
                    quite conventional. But I was surprised by the vertical scroll images, as I was expecting a
                    horizontal carousel.
                    The below description and user review sections are also quite conventional, and I know what they are
                    aiming for.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>What specific problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
                <p>
                    The vertical scroll images are designed to show the product in different angle and show parts of it
                    that can't be shown in one image (e.g. the inside of the cap plug). The customization options are to
                    allow users to customize their product to their liking. The description and user review sections are
                    to provide more information about the product and to convince the users to buy it.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>What other UI elements could have been used in this context? Why were they not used?</p>
                <p>
                    The vertical scroll images could have been a horizontal carousel, but I think the vertical scroll
                    is working . The customization
                    options could have been a dropdown menu, but I think the button groups are better as they allow the
                    users to see all the options at once and make a decision more easily. The description and user
                    review sections could have been a popup window, but I think the current design is better as it
                    allows the users to see the information without leaving the page.

                    Since there is a search bar on top, I went on to search for 'scotch', and the search result page is
                    a catalog of scotch whiskey. Because I want to find a scotch whiskey within $50, I used the 'sort
                    by' dropdown and selected 'price(low first)'. Then I went through the catalog with its bottom
                    pagination button and picked a bottle that I like at approximately $40 ~ $50 with a 4~5 star rating,
                    and went into its detail page.
                    <br />
                    In the detail page, there's an image of the bottle on left and its description on right. Below is a

                    <br />
                    In terms of the detail page, the layout of item images on right and item description on left is
                    very conventional in online shopping sites. The customer review section is also a common practice.

                <p>
                    Yes, the elements like the search bar, 'sort by' dropdown, and pagination control are standard in
                    e-commerce sites. Their functionality is familiar due to their consistent use across various online
                    shopping platforms, making it intuitive for users.

                <p>What specific problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
                <p>
                    he search bar is designed to quickly find specific items. The 'sort by' dropdown helps in organizing
                    search results based on user preferences like price or rating. Pagination controls manage the
                    display of a large number of products, making the browsing experience more manageable.

                <p>
                    Another UI element that can be used in the catalog page is a filter dropdown menu that allows users
                    to filter the products by price range, rating, etc. It wasn't used probably to keep the interface
                    simple. Also, a comparison tool could be helpful for side-by-side evaluation of different products.

                    Universal elements include search bars, pagination controls, 'sort by' dropdowns, product detail
                    layouts (image on one side, description on the other), and customer review sections. These elements

                    The three-column layout in the Micro Center's product detail page was somewhat unusual. Also, the
                    vertical scroll for images in Live Larq's product page was a different approach compared to the more
                    common horizontal carousel.

                <p>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</p>
                <p>
                    Customization options in button groups on Live Larq's site were specific to their product range. The
                    emphasis on high-quality imagery and detailed product descriptions varies from site to site,
                    depending on the product type.

                <p>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have
                    applied that technique successfully?</p>
                <p>
                    Live Larq's customization options were standout, providing a clear and interactive way to select
                    product attributes. Other stores, especially those with customizable products, could benefit from a
                    similar approach.

                <p>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable?
                    When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</p>
                <p>
                    Interacting with these sites, I felt most comfortable when I was able to find the product I wanted
                    or the category associated with it immeidately on the home page, for example, I liked the clear
                    layout of the top navigation bar on Black Sheep Skateshop's site. I was most disrupted when I had to
                    go through multiple pages of catalog to find the product I wanted, for example, I had to go through
                    multiple pages to find the right bottle for myself within my budget and with a good rating on Total
                    Wine & More's site, while this could be made easier with a filter dropdown menu.
